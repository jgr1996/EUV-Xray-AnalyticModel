# EUV/Xray Analytic Model

This program is a Bayesian hierarchical model for constraining the underlying planetary distribution of close-in exoplanets. This is achieved by exploiting the photoevaporation valley uncovered from the California Kepler Survey (CKS) (Fulton et al. 2017) and the analytic model proposed by Owen and Wu (2017).

# Files

- main_MCMC.py
  * run this for constraining the 1D radius space histogram.

  * run this for constraining the 2D period-radius space histogram.

# Data and Analysis

- All MCMC walker positions are saved to a "./RESULTS" directory. All analysis can be done from there.
